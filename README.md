# SC1015-project-Z139-Group-1

SC1015 is an introductory module offered by NTU giving an insight to the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and basic skills in those domains. We have been assigned to identify a suitable dataset, and from there, use data scientific techniques to answer a problem statement.

## Dataset
Our dataset was sourced from WHO and contains the latest edition of data (as of 2023) of life expectancy data of different countries, with other corresponding data such as age-specific mortality, presence of diseases in countries, etc.

## Problem definition
We focused on attempting to identify the years of healthy life expectancy at birth (of both sexes) of a country, based on corresponding data.
